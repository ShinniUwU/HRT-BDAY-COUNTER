# Personal Site Tracker

Welcome to my personal site tracker! Here, you'll find some nifty tools to keep track of important dates and events in my life. You can access the tracker [here](https://shinniuwu.github.io/HRT-BDAY-COUNTER/). Let's dive in and see what's under the hood.

## Features

### Countdown Timer
This handy timer shows you exactly how long it is until my birthday. Simple and straightforward.

### HRT Tracker
For those curious, I've included a tracker to log the days I've been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). It's a personal journey, and I like to keep tabs on my progress.

### Dating Anniversary Tracker
Want to know how long it's been since I started dating my significant other? Look no further. It's a sweet little reminder of the time we've spent together.

### Random GIFs
For a touch of fun, I've added a feature that displays random GIFs. Click on the GIF to reveal a surprise animation!

## How It Works

### Countdown Logic
The countdown timer ticks away, updating every second until my birthday arrives. Once the big day is here, a special message pops up to mark the occasion.

### HRT & Dating Anniversary Calculation
These trackers simply count the number of days since specific dates. It's a straightforward way to keep track of milestones.

### Random GIFs
Clicking on the GIF triggers a playful animation where more GIFs slide onto the screen. It's just a bit of whimsy to liven up the page!
